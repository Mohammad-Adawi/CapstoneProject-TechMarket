# TECHMarket - Capstone Project 


# Problem Definition
Due to current COVID-19 pandemic scenario, majority of small business here in Edmonton are closed for operations and struggling to survive and it is very difficult for customers to go physically and shop. As most of the organizations have already shifted their gears to remote work hence there is an increased demand of tech products and there is a clear shortage of such products in market as well. 
# Project Plan
In order to counter this problem, we are plaining to design a full-stack online shopping web application that will be simple and user-friendly for such small business to operate remotely. A user can find selected tech items like laptops, cell phones, iPads of famous brands with good deals here.
